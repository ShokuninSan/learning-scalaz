/** A knights quest

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming):

  Many common programming concepts can be described in terms of a monad
  structure, including side effects such as input/output, variable assignment,
  exception handling, parsing, nondeterminism (!), concurrency, and continuations.
  This allows these concepts to be defined in a purely functional manner,
  without major extensions to the language's semantics.

  LYAHFGG:
    Hereâ€™s a problem that really lends itself to being solved with
    non-determinism. Say you have a chess board and only one knight piece on it.
    We want to find out if the knight can reach a certain position in three
    moves.
